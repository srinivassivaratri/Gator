# üêä Gator - The Ultimate Terminal RSS Feed Aggregator

Gator is a lightweight command-line tool built in Go that allows you to aggregate and read RSS feeds directly from your terminal. Stay updated with your favorite websites without ever leaving your command line!

## Why Gator?

Keeping up with numerous RSS feeds can be challenging, especially when most readers are bloated web apps or desktop applications. As someone who spends a lot of time in the terminal, I wanted an efficient, terminal-based solution that is:

- **Fast and lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, perfect for low-memory devices.
- **Entirely terminal-based**: No GUI, no distractions‚Äîjust pure command-line goodness.
- **Multi-user friendly**: Supports multiple user accounts on the same system.
- **Smart feed management**: Easily follow and unfollow feeds, with automatic updates.

I built Gator to solve these problems, providing a simple CLI tool that fetches and displays RSS feeds directly in your terminal. No browser needed, no fancy UI‚Äîjust your favorite content at your fingertips.
